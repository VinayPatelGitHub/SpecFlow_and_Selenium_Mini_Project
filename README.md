# SpecFlow and Selenium Mini Project

### Project Aim

The project aim is to create an automated testing framework of a website. Using page object models (POM) in combination with a testing framework offers additional benefits to traditional testing methods. These benefits are reduced time and cost in regards to changing, extending and maintaining the test framework. Which is a huge benefit in an agile work environment where changes to the project specification are frequent. 

Selenium is a web testing tool which allows the tester to interact with a website from within visual basics. This offers an reliable method of interacting with a website and therefore achieving an automated testing of a website.

SpecFlow is testing tool use to implement behaviour driven development. It assists with converting user stories into test cases. SpecFlow's main benefit is improving communication between the test objectives and test outcome.

The challenge in this project is to create a automated testing framework of a website using the tools previously mentioned.

### Project Review

The automated testing framework of a website was achieved using POM, Selenium and SpecFlow. The Website tested was, "https://www.saucedemo.com/index.html". Partial testing of this website was achieved. Due to the nature of the testing framework additional tests can easily be added.

The biggest challenge in this project was finding the most reliable ways to link the automated tests with webpage elements. In future projects it would be useful for web developers to have this understanding of automated tests so they can build their websites using a unique 'Id' naming convention.

### Project Retrospective

This was a very short projects all challenges were overcome quickly. This was partly down to the readability of the testing framework that made error identification and correction swift
